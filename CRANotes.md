# Consumer Rights Act 2015
In the UK, sale of digital goods is covered by the CRA.
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents/enacted

Relevant points:
Part 1
Chapter 3 is for digital content

## Definitions
2.8 “Goods” means any tangible moveable items, but that includes water, gas and electricity if and only if they are put up for supply in a limited volume or set quantity.
2.9 “Digital content” means data which are produced and supplied in digital form.
33.7 A contract to which this Chapter applies is referred to in this Part as a “contract to supply digital content”.


## 33 Free content
33.2.a
> This Chapter also applies to a contract for a trader to supply digital content to a consumer, if—
> (a)it is supplied free with goods or services or other digital content for which the consumer pays a price  

i.e. this means the rules apply to free stuff given alongside a purchase.
So if a game is free, and a purchase is made, you could argue that the free game exists supplied with the digital content paid for

## 34 Digital content to be of satisfactory quality
34.1
> Every contract to supply digital content is to be treated as including a term that the quality of the digital content is satisfactory.

i.e. every sale of a game implies that the game as delivered must be satisfactory. A game suddenly dying is obviously unsatisfactory

34.2
> The quality of digital content is satisfactory if it meets the standard that a reasonable person would consider satisfactory, taking account of—
> (a)any description of the digital content,
> (b)the price mentioned in section 33(1) or (2)(b) (if relevant), and
> (c)all the other relevant circumstances (see subsection (5)).
34.4
>The term mentioned in subsection (1) does not cover anything which makes the quality of the digital content unsatisfactory—
> (a)which is specifically drawn to the consumer’s attention before the contract is made,
34.5
> The relevant circumstances mentioned in subsection (2)(c) include any public statement about the specific characteristics of the digital content made by the trader, the producer or any representative of the trader or the producer.

i.e. unless the seller said up front that the product has a date after which it will become unplayable, and is explicit about that date, a game suddenly dying is unsatisfactory quality

34.3
> The quality of digital content includes its state and condition; and the following aspects (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of digital content—
> (a)fitness for all the purposes for which digital content of that kind is usually supplied;
> (b)freedom from minor defects;
> (c)safety;
> (d)durability.

Games dying runs afoul of 
* 34.3.a - games used to not die, that is a recent invention
* 34.3.d - a game becoming unplayable when digital files are infinitely durable


## 35 additional purpose
35.1
> Subsection (3) applies to a contract to supply digital content if before the contract is made the consumer makes known to the trader (expressly or by implication) any particular purpose for which the consumer is contracting for the digital content.
35.3
> The contract is to be treated as including a term that the digital content is reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which digital content of that kind is usually supplied.

If a player made the claim before purchase that they wanted to be able to play forever, this would be part of the contract of sale.
In practice this doesn't happen because you're buying form online storefronts which don't let you make demands like this.
Could players expecting to play a game forever be an implicit request? I think so, given that is the norm for games.

## 36 As described
36.1 
> Every contract to supply digital content is to be treated as including a term that the digital content will match any description of it given by the trader to the consumer.
36.4
> A change to any of that information, made before entering into the contract or later, is not effective unless expressly agreed between the consumer and the trader.

Publishers have to be up front if they want to kill the game, or make a change that makes it subject to dying.
Players would have to mutually agree to that for it to be allowed

## 40 Modifications by the trader or third party
40.1
> Where under a contract a trader supplies digital content to a consumer subject to the right of the trader or a third party to modify the digital content, the following provisions apply in relation to the digital content as modified as they apply in relation to the digital content as supplied under the contract—
> (a)section 34 (quality);
> (b)section 35 (fitness for a particular purpose);
> (c)section 36 (description).
40.2
> Subsection (1)(c) does not prevent the trader from improving the features of, or adding new features to, the digital content, as long as—
> (a)the digital content continues to match the description of it given by the trader to the consumer, and
> (b)the digital content continues to conform to the information provided by the trader as mentioned in subsection (3) of section 36, subject to any change to that information that has been agreed in accordance with subsection (4) of that section.

If a publisher makes a change to a game after purchase which could result in the game dying, that violates the original description and quality of the product.
Therefore it is in breach of contract.

## 42 Consumer's rights to enforce terms about digital content
42.2
> If the digital content does not conform to the contract, the consumer’s rights (and the provisions about them and when they are available) are—
> (a)the right to repair or replacement (see section 43);
> (b) the right to a price reduction (see section 44).

Games dying mean that the player is entitled to have the game repaired, or to get a partial refund

42.7
>Those other remedies include any of the following that is open to the consumer in the circumstances—
> (a)claiming damages;
> (b)seeking to recover money paid where the consideration for payment of the money has failed;
> (c)seeking specific performance;
> (d)seeking an order for specific implement;

Games dying mean a player could seek damages or a refund.
42.7.c and d are very important - the player could demand that the game be put into a playable state.


## 42 Time Period
42.9
> For the purposes of subsection (2), digital content which does not conform to the contract at any time within the period of six months beginning with the day on which it was supplied must be taken not to have conformed to the contract when it was supplied.
42.10
> Subsection (9) does not apply if—
> (a)it is established that the digital content did conform to the contract when it was supplied, or
> (b)its application is incompatible with the nature of the digital content or with how it fails to conform to the contract.

Claims could be made to any game that dies within 6 months. Beyond that, you need to meet additional criteria:

If the game was built such that it could die (e.g. reliance on an online server that is out of your control) then you could argue that:
Under 42.10.a at time of supply, the game quality did not conform to the expected quality

You could also argue under 42.10.b, video games are expected to last longer than 6 months anyway, so the 6 month limit is not applicable

## 43 Right to repair or replacement
43.1
> This section applies if the consumer has the right to repair or replacement.

Do players have the right to repair or replacement? We are arguing that they should.

43.2

> If the consumer requires the trader to repair or replace the digital content, the trader must—
> (a)do so within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer; and
> (b)bear any necessary costs incurred in doing so (including in particular the cost of any labour, materials or postage).

Who is the trader? We are arguing that this should be the responsibility of the game publisher.
The law could interpret it as the storefront that sold the game.
Either way, if a repair challenge is successful, someone has to take responsibility for it

43.3

> The consumer cannot require the trader to repair or replace the digital content if that remedy (the repair or the replacement)—
> (a)is impossible, or
> (b)is disproportionate compared to the other of those remedies.

This is a tricky point. 43.3.a means that a publisher could argue making a game work offline is impossible. But as we have examples showing it is possible, that's not a valid argument
43.3.b means that the publisher can choose repair or replacement.
In practice this doesn't offer any meaningful distinction. Replacing the digital files wouldn't suddenly make them work.
except in the Overwatch case where a replacement sequel game is made, and the publisher may push people to that.
Then it becomes a question of whether that is actually a valid replacement.

43.4
> Either of those remedies is disproportionate compared to the other if it imposes costs on the trader which, compared to those imposed by the other, are unreasonable, taking into account—
> (b)the significance of the lack of conformity, and
> (c)whether the other remedy could be effected without significant inconvenience to the consumer.
43.5
> Any question as to what is a reasonable time or significant inconvenience is to be determined taking account of—
> (a)the nature of the digital content, and
> (b)the purpose for which the digital content was obtained or accessed.

Under 43.4.b and c and 43.5 you can say that replacement is not adequate for the consumer, and that repair should be used instead regardless of cost
Replacing a broken game with a different one that works would not conform to the original description, and would most likely inconvenience the consumer
But again, this would depend on exactly what the replacement given was.
Under this, you could say that repair in the form of offering a server emulator / patch file / some other documented configuration might offer minor inconvenience to the consumer,
but compared to losing access to the game entirely, it is not a significant inconvenience

43.6
>A consumer who requires or agrees to the repair of digital content cannot require the trader to replace it without giving the trader a reasonable time to repair it (unless giving the trader that time would cause significant inconvenience to the consumer).
43.7 
> A consumer who requires or agrees to the replacement (repeats)

Both the player and the publisher need to agree on a reasonable time frame to repair.
If the publisher knows in advance when a game will be killed, they should be able to plan for this in advance.

43.8 
> In this Chapter, “repair” in relation to digital content that does not conform to a contract, means making it conform.

Repair means making the game playable

## 44 Right to price reduction

This does not apply here

## 45 Right to a refund
If the publisher or player argues for a refund, this is where that is laid out.
We are not pursuing refunds though.

## 46 Remedy for damage to device or to other digital content

46.1
> This section applies if—
> (a)a trader supplies digital content to a consumer under a contract,
> (b)the digital content causes damage to a device or to other digital content,
> (c)the device or digital content that is damaged belongs to the consumer, and
> (d)the damage is of a kind that would not have occurred if the trader had exercised reasonable care and skill.

If the online connection is digital content under the contract, then the player can argue that damage to their copy of the game has arisen from the online connection being pulled
If DRM or anti-cheat is digital content under the contract, then any effect resulting from DRM failure is damage to their copy of the game

46.2
> If the consumer requires the trader to provide a remedy under this section, the trader must either—
> (a)repair the damage in accordance with subsection (3), or
> (b)compensate the consumer for the damage with an appropriate payment.
In both cases, the player can seek damages, and then seek repair or some other compensation as noted above

## 47 Liability that cannot be excluded or restricted
47.1
>A term of a contract to supply digital content is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude or restrict the trader’s liability arising under any of these provisions—
> (a)section 34 (digital content to be of satisfactory quality),
> (b)section 35 (digital content to be fit for particular purpose),
> (c)section 36 (digital content to be as described),

This essentially says that any EULA that absolved the publisher of responsibility to fix their game isn't a valid contract

47.2

> That also means that a term of a contract to supply digital content is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would—
> (a)exclude or restrict a right or remedy in respect of a liability under a provision listed in subsection (1),
> (b)make such a right or remedy or its enforcement subject to a restrictive or onerous condition,
> (c)allow a trader to put a person at a disadvantage as a result of pursuing such a right or remedy, or
> (d)exclude or restrict rules of evidence or procedure.

This says that any EULA that prevents a player from making a damages claim or prevents them from seeking a repair is invalid
