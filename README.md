# The Report
The goal of this repository is to create a report that comprehensively summarises all of the information around the Stop Killing Games campaign.
The document should do so in a formal way that includes all of the evidence, argumentation, and recommendations that currently exist across various websites, videos, chat rooms, and more.
The document should use language capable of  introducing and explaining technical or video game specific concepts to a lay audience.
This is because without a central agreed upon document, when lawmakers or consumer groups attempt to make action, they may misunderstand the goal, or not know where to view existing discussion.
A central document will also help as part of campaigning and lobbying for change, and act as a record of the campaign taken.

# TODOs:
- [x] Copy the main argument content from the SKG site here
* Add more arguments
* Add more formal explanations of what it says
* Add references and citations to back up claims
* Include a glossary to explain technical terms to a lay audience
* Contact game developers / publishers who have released playable versions to ask for opinions
    * RQS:
    * What was the motivation for shutting the game down in a playable way?
    * What costs were associated with doing this?
* Update the killed games table
* Summarise various legal documents arguments
    * CRA

Less important TODOs:
* Make a nicer front page
* Graphics / tables
* Normalise all language and terms
* Decide what should be references and what should be footnotes
