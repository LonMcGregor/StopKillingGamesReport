The goal of this repository is to create a report that comprehensively summarises all of the information around the Stop Killing Games campaign.
The document should do so in a formal way that includes all of the evidence, argumentation, and recommendations that currently exist across various websites, videos, chatrooms, and more.
The document should use language capable of  introducing and explaining technical or video game specific concepts to a lay audience.
This is because without a central agreed upon document, when lawmakers or consumer groups attempt to make action, they may misunderstand the goal, or not know where to view existing discussion.
A central document will also help as part of campaigning and lobbying for change, and act as a record of the campaign taken.

TODOs:
* Copy the main argument content from the SKG site here
* Add more formal explanations of what it says
* Add references and citations to back up claims
* Include a glossary to explain technical terms to a lay audience

Less important TODOs:
* Make a nicer front page
* Grabics / tables
